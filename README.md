# Grade Calculator
## Brief overview
Grade Calculator is a small project which allows you to enter your grades, and it gives three different results.

* How much that paper contributes to your grade
* What your current mark in the course overall is
* What your current mark for the year overall is

This project can be see at westshae.com/gradecalculator/

## How to run
1. Clone the repo to your computer
2. Install nodejs
3. Run the command "npm install" to install dependancies.
4. RUn the command "npm start" to run the website and open it in your browser

## Technologies used

* ReactJS
* Javascript
* HTML, CSS

## Why I made this

### Reason one.
I had just finished the trimester, and I found two problems.

1. All my grades were given out of their own mark, and each different type of work was worth a different amount in the course, making it annoying to calculate.
2. Even manually calculating these, it would be easy to make a mistake if you had to use a phone calculator, which many people would use.

### Reason two.
Having just finished my portfolio website, I knew I had areas I needed to learn about to improve my web development skills.

Primaily, I wanted to work on passing data from children to parents, and vice versa, but I also wanted to try out a new method of programming.I started this project and ignored all styling to the very end of the project. 

## What I learnt through this project

1. Passing data between parents and children in ReactJS. Primarily I used props to give data to children, using callback functions inside of props to give data back to parents.
2. Working on the logic on the project before the styling. It sped up my progress 10 fold by focusing on the logicial side of my program. Being able to setup the style at the end meant I didn't have to change anything, and wouldn't have to add for new features after the fact.
3. Further experience with Grid layouts. I learnt a bit about layouts in my portfolio, but decided I needed more work on it, so a majority of this website uses it.
4. I hadn't used switch statements much in the past, so decided to dive into learning them for this project. This change made it much easier to understand my code, as well as add extra statements after the fact.
5. React hooks in functional components. For my previous projects, I started with class components which don't have access to react hooks. This was primarily learning about the useState hook to store information in components, as well as useEffect to execute code on the change of certain state values.
6. Designing my site. I haven't had much experience designing projects, so I thought I'd add a bit more colour to my already dark themes. I'd say it definitely adds a touch my portfolio website doesn't have.
